## Projects

### Acid (Android App)

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/Acid](https://github.com/raver1975/Acid)
- **Google Play:** [play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acid&hl=en_US)
- **Package:** `com.acid`
- **Category:** Music & Audio
- **First Released:** February 4, 2014
- **Downloads:** 10,000+
- **Rating:** ~4.1 stars (330 reviews)

**Description:** Real-time emulation of a Roland TB-303 synthesizer with TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines. Users can draw in notes on a sequencer, adjust sound parameters with knobs, and auto-create random patterns.

**Key Features:**
- TB-303 bass synthesizer emulation
- TR-808 and TR-909 drum machine emulation
- Pattern sequencer with draw-in note editing
- Export songs as WAV and FLAC files
- Upload FLAC files to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized sharing
- Open source -- community contributions welcomed

### Acid 2 (Android App)

- **Google Play:** [play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acid2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acid2)
- **Package:** `com.acid2`

**Description:** Sequel to Acid featuring two TB-303 synths. Described as a work in progress. Retains WAV/FLAC export and IPFS upload capabilities.

### Horde

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/horde](https://github.com/raver1975/horde)

**Description:** AI-powered music groovebox. Combines artificial intelligence with music production tools in a groovebox-style application.

### Wub

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/Wub](https://github.com/raver1975/Wub)

**Description:** Music remixing software ("Wub lives again!"). Analyzes songs, breaks them into beats and bars, and allows users to mix and match pieces. Pressing "m" triggers "magic" mode where the computer auto-composes a remix. Results can be saved as WAV files.

### AndroidSegmentation

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/AndroidSegmentation](https://github.com/raver1975/AndroidSegmentation)

**Description:** TensorFlow Lite Android demo for DeepLab object/image segmentation. Demonstrates real-time semantic segmentation on Android devices.

### GoogleMapLibgdx

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/GoogleMapLibgdx](https://github.com/raver1975/GoogleMapLibgdx)

**Description:** A Google Map-based game built with the libGDX cross-platform Java game framework. Uses the `com.klemstinegroup.googlemap` package namespace.

### MyFaceIsMelting

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/MyFaceIsMelting](https://github.com/raver1975/MyFaceIsMelting)

**Description:** Project involving Docker-based workflows (Docker commands found in the repo). Likely related to image/video processing or generative AI effects.

### Stable Diffusion

- **Repository:** [github.com/raver1975/stablediffusion](https://github.com/raver1975/stablediffusion)

**Description:** Fork or implementation related to Stable Diffusion AI image generation.

## Technical Profile

### Primary Languages & Frameworks
- **Java** -- primary language across most projects
- **Android SDK** -- mobile app development
- **libGDX** -- cross-platform game/app framework
- **TensorFlow Lite** -- on-device ML inference
- **Deeplearning4j (DL4J)** -- JVM-based deep learning (filed [issue #3120](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3120) about multi-timestep regression with multicolumn input data)

### Domains of Interest
1. **Electronic Music Production** -- TB-303/TR-808/TR-909 emulation, sequencers, grooveboxes, auto-remixing
2. **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** -- deep learning, image segmentation, stable diffusion, AI music generation
3. **Decentralized Technology** -- IPFS integration for peer-to-peer file sharing
4. **Computer Vision** -- Android-based image segmentation, face-related generative effects
5. **Game Development** -- libGDX-based applications

### Notable Technical Choices
- Open-sources projects and invites community contributions
- Uses the `com.klemstinegroup` Java package namespace
- Integrates IPFS for decentralized media sharing (early adopter pattern)
- Combines music and AI across multiple projects (Acid, Horde, Wub)
- Engages with JVM-based ML frameworks (DL4J) rather than Python-centric tools

## Community Engagement

- **Appleton Makerspace:** Listed as an author/member of the Appleton Makerspace, the largest community-run non-profit DIY workshop in northeast Wisconsin
- **Open Source:** Maintains multiple public repositories on GitHub; welcomes developer contributions (noted in Acid app developer responses to reviews)
- **Deeplearning4j Community:** Filed issues and contributed gists related to DL4J regression examples (March 2017)
- **Keybase:** Maintains a verified cryptographic identity linking GitHub and other accounts
